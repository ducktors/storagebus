### Introduction
This security policy outlines the measures we take to ensure the security of our open-source project hosted on GitHub. We are committed to protecting our project and its users from potential security vulnerabilities.

### Scope
This security policy covers all aspects of our project, including code repositories, issue trackers, documentation, and communication channels.

### Vulnerability Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to our [Lead Maintainer](https://maksim.dev/). We encourage responsible disclosure and ask that you provide sufficient details to help us reproduce and validate the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Assessment
Upon receiving a vulnerability report, our team will promptly assess and validate the reported vulnerability. We prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact. We aim to provide an initial response within 72 hours and will keep you informed of the progress and expected timeline for addressing the vulnerability.

### Secure Development Practices
We encourage all contributors to follow secure development practices. This includes writing secure code, performing regular code reviews, and utilizing secure libraries or frameworks. 

### Code Review Process
All code changes undergo a thorough review process to identify and address security issues. Our core team members are responsible for reviewing code and ensuring its security. We evaluate code based on established criteria, including input validation, access controls, and secure data handling.

### Security Updates and Patching
We are committed to providing timely security updates and patches. When vulnerabilities are identified and fixed, we will release updates following a coordinated disclosure process. We strive to maintain backward compatibility whenever possible.

### Dependency Management
We actively manage project dependencies to ensure they are up to date and include the latest security patches. We regularly review and update dependencies, following industry best practices for secure dependency management.

### Communication
Security-related information will be shared with our project users through the Security section.

### Review and Revision
We regularly review and update our security policy to reflect changes in our project, emerging security threats, and best practices. We welcome feedback and suggestions from the community to help us improve the security of our project.
